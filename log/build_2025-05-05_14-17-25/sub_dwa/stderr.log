CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmotion_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "motion_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "motion_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

    motion_msgsConfig.cmake
    motion_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "motion_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "motion_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "motion_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
